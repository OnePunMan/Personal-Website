            Projects don't simply imply programming, it's the diversity of one's contributions that make their experiences interesting.
            This section contains my projects that range from programming, filming making, 3D modeling, and music.
            Of course, as a Computer Science student, the main highlights will still be my coding projects.

                          This is my most recent game development project. My friend and I are working together on re-creating
                          our own version of the classic Tower Defense game. The idea of the game is to build towers of different types
                          to defend against incoming enemies.<br><br>

                          As of right now, we have different classes of towers with different damage and range. I am currently working on the enemy pathing
                          to allow the game to read the path from a file instead of hard coding the path which is currently the case.

                          This is my second game using the Pygame Python library; it is a re-make of the classic space invaders game.
                          However, my version includes many new components including boss ships, power-ups and different types of enemies.<br><br>

                          This is the first game that I independently create without heavy reliance on sources (except official documentation), and I am
                          proud to say that this is my first fully functional game that I have implemented.

                          PicFive is the project that my team and I worked on at the UofTHacks 2017 Hackathon. The game prompts the player with five words (nouns)
                          and the player has to upload an image that closely associates with as many of the five words as possible.<br><br>

                          Through the use of the Clarifai API, we are able to use image processing and extract words associated with elements in the images.
                          With this data, the game will return an adjusted score between 1 and 100 indicating how well of a match the photo is with respect to the five words.
                          In addition, the top 10 scores are displayed on the Leaderboards.

                          As University of Waterloo's well known signature animal - the Canadian Goose, I decided to make a mini game that is related to them.
                          Together with two of my friends, we participated in MLH's LocalHackDay 2016 event for our first 12-hour mini Hackathon.
                          This is our first time experiementing with Android App development.
                          Using Android Studio as our framework, we have learned (and struggled) a lot during the development of this project.<br><br>

                          This project is essentially a mini-game where you have to flip 9 cards to the right orientation to reveal a picture of a beautiful goose.
                          The catch is however, that when a card is flipped, all its adjacent cards will flip too, which means you could end up coving up an already
                          partially solved puzzle!
