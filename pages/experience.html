              <p style="font-size: 120%"> 
                I am currently on my first co-op internship as a full stack web developer at MyEffect Inc, which is a service platform that allows users keep track of their social impacts
                to promote leadership and community involvement. The platform is built using many languages and tools: AngularJS, Bootstrap, and Sass are the major
                front-end components and SQL, Sequelize, Redis, and Node are the major server back-end components.<br><br>

                In addition, MyEffect is also partnering with a professor at the University of Waterloo on a project that focuses on implementing a self-adaptive platform in optimizing database efficiency. The desired result would be that based on
                the user's activities, the database will adjust itself to optimize its performance.<br><br>

                Being a full-stack developer, I am responsible for a variety of tasks including UI design, implementing new features, server
                authentication, bug reporting and QA. Since the company is a start-up, each employee's contribution is much more significant and noticeable. In addition,
                being an undergraduate research student for the school, I also have other tasks including report writing, as well as conducting research on web optimization, which
                contributes to the on-going research project the university is working on.

              <p style="font-size: 120%">
                This is my first 'real' hackathon that I have ever attended. It was held at
                the University of Toronto; with three other friends from my school, we created
                a web game called 'PicFive!'. <br><br>

                This game involved some machine learning concepts that I never experienced before;
                overall, it was a really amazing experience; I had a chance to work with a very skilled team, as well
                as seeing lot of different interesting projects made by others.
                Details about this project can be found
                <a href="/pages/projects.html#picFive"><u>here</u></a> in my 'Projects' page.

                MLH Local Hack Day is a small hackathon that lasts for only 12 hours. During this event, my team
                and I decided to explore some Android app development since neither of us has had any experience
                in mobile development.<br><br>

                We created a simple puzzle game called 'WatRGoose'; nothing fancy was done here, but it is
                a hilarious puzzle game that involves the school's beloved animal - the goose. The goal of the game is strategically
                flip all cards so that it reveals a picture of a goose. Full details of this
                game can be found <a href="/pages/projects.html#watRGoose"><u>here</u></a> in the 'Projects' section.

                As the vice president of the science club of my high school, I helped organized events including science experiments, fundraisers, and
                carnival activities. Some of the events include the Bridge Building Contest, Egg Drop, Alka Seltzer Challenge and the Paper Airplane Contest.<br><br>

                Some of the highlights will be featured in the 'Videos' section.

              <p style="font-size: 120%">
                Why is our band called Last Minute? You guessed it, our band formed the day before the audition for
                the talent show. Luckily for us, every member of the band was skilled and talented. We eventually were able
                to perform at both the talent show and the school's concert.<br><br>

                I was the Bass player in this band; I don't know how to play the bass very well, but with my previous experience
                in music, I was able to pick it up rather quickly.<br><br>

                It's quite unfortunate that our band formed near the end of our senior year of high school, hence we only performed once;
                but this is one proud moment that I will always remember - being a part of a Rock Band!
