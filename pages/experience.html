                    Mobile C# developer on an unreleased mobile project in its prototyping phase. Responsible for designing and implementing core gameplay features, experimental concepts for evaluation, as well as performance analysis and optimization.<br><br>

                    The team that I was on was very small, this means that I was able to make a significant amount of contributions to the project ranging from implement core gameplay features to trying out experimental changes.<br><br>

                    Also, I wrote scripts and editor tools that provided a lot of conveniences for the team. One specific example was a command line script that can deploy an application to multiple devices at the same time.

                <p style="font-size: 120%">
                  I worked as a Game Programmer at Behaviour Interactive for my second Co-op term. I was a part of the front-end team for the mobile game <strong>
                    <a href="https://www.westworldmobile.com/en" target="_blank">Westworld</a></strong>. I mostly worked with the Unity game engine and the C# programming language. <br><br>

                  This was a completely new experience working with a much larger team. Everything is a lot more organized and systematic, especially when it
                  comes to the specialization of roles that each person has. Also, the entire process of task reviews, submission, and approval is done in a very organized way.<br><br>

                  I have worked on implementing new game features, UI redesign, bug fixing, refactoring code, front-end optimizations, as well as testing pre-existing features.
                  The offical version of the game has been released in May of 2018 in the app store and the play store; it is quite the plesaure being able to see my contributions go to production.<br><br>

                  Working at Canada's largest independent game company was a great learning experience. I am quite
                  fascinated by the level of organization and coordination that everyone maintains. I am definitely considering game development as a future career option.

                  In continuation from my last co-op term, I decided to stay on board with the team as a part-time URA (Undergraduate Research Assistant) in doing research and analysis
                  on database optimization and self-adaptive web platforms.<br><br>

                  I completed both research and programming tasks during my study term on data collection and analyzation using machine learning, as well as writing new scripts and tools
                  that help analyze pre-existing data. As of last term, I was able to successully format raw user analytics data into graphs and use regressions to model trends found in
                  their activities. During the duration of this term, I developped a Python script that is capable of detecting closely associated tables in SQL databases based off frequency tallies
                  generated by the database.

                My position for my first co-op internship was as a full stack web developer at MyEffect Inc, which is a web service that allows non-profit organizations to
                keep track of their social impacts to promote leadership and community involvement. The platform is built using many languages and tools: AngularJS, Bootstrap,
                and Sass are the major front-end components and SQL, Sequelize, Redis, and Node are the major server back-end components.<br><br>

                In addition, MyEffect is also partnering with a professor from the STAR team at the University of Waterloo on a project that focuses on implementing a self-adaptive
                platform in optimizing database efficiency from the company.
                Through user's trafic and activity patterns, the goal is to create a system where data flow can be predicted and requested in advance.<br><br>

                As a full-stack developer, I was responsible for a variety of tasks including UI design, implementing new features, server
                authentication, bug reporting and QA. Since the company is a start-up, each employee's contribution is much more significant and noticeable. In addition,
                being an undergraduate research student for the school, I also have other tasks including report writing, research on web optimization, and writing scripts for data collection.

                This is my first 'real' hackathon that I have ever attended. It was held at
                the University of Toronto; with three other friends from my school, we created
                a web game called <a href="/pages/projects.html#picFive">'PicFive!'</a>. <br><br>

                This game involved some machine learning concepts that I never experienced before;
                overall, it was a really amazing experience; I had a chance to work with a very skilled team, as well
                as seeing lots of different interesting projects made by others.

                MLH Local Hack Day is a mini hackathon that lasts for only 12 hours. During this event, my team
                and I decided to explore some Android app development since neither of us has had any experience
                in mobile development.<br><br>

                We created a simple puzzle game called <a href="/pages/projects.html#watRGoose">'WatRGoose'</a>; nothing fancy was done here, but it is
                a hilarious puzzle game that involves the school's beloved animal - the goose. The goal of the game is strategically
                flip all cards so that it reveals a picture of a goose. Full details of this

                to promote our music program. It was really a great experience and music still remains as one of my most favourited hobbies.

                Why is our band called Last Minute? You guessed it, our band formed the day before the audition for
                the talent show. Luckily for us, every member of the band was skilled and talented. We eventually were able
                to perform at both the talent show and the school's concert.<br><br>

                I was the Bass player in this band; I don't know how to play the bass very well, but with my previous experience
                in music, I was able to pick it up rather quickly.<br><br>

                It's quite unfortunate that our band formed near the end of our senior year of high school, hence we only performed once;
                but this is one proud moment that I will always remember - being a part of a Rock Band!

                My passion for programming and game development was present ever since high school, hence
                a few friends and I decided to create our own game development club. We had members joining with
                a variety of skills ranging from developers, artists, and musicians.<br><br>

                Although with our limited skills at the time, we were not able to fully complete any projects, we
                gained lots of new knowledge in game development and other concepts such as asynchronous programming. with
                the knowledge I have now, I look forward to restarting some of the unfinished projects once again.<br><br>

                Game development is still one of my favourite types of programming hobbies today, I like having the ability
                to design a game anyway I like and anyway I want. All my game development projects can be found on my 'Projects'
