              <p style="font-size: 120%">
                I am currently on my first co-op internship as a full stack web developer at MyEffect Inc, which is a service platform that allow users keep track of their social impacts
                to promote leadership and community involvement. The platform in built using many languages and tools: AngularJS, Bootstrap and Sass are the major
                front-end components and SQL, Sequelize, Redis and Node are the major server back-end components.<br><br>

                In addition, MyEffect is also partnering with a professor at the University of Waterloo on
                a project that focuses on implementing a self-adaptive platform in optimizing database efficiency. The desired result would be that based on
                the users activities, the database will adjust itself to optize its performance.<br><br>

                Being a full stack developer, I am reponsible for a varity of tasks including UI design, implementing new features, server
                authentication, bug reporting and QA. Since the company is a start-up, each employee's contribution is much more significant and noticable. In addition,
                being a undergraduate research student for the school, I also have other tasks including report writing, as well as conducting research on web optimization, which
                contributes to the on-going research project the the university is working on.
