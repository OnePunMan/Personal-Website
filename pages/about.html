                Hi there! My name is Jackie, I am a Programmer, Mathematician, Musician and I am currently
                a Co-op student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.<br><br>

                My website contains lots of interesting stuff about me; ranging professional content including
                my education, experience, awards and projects, to my hobbies including photos, videos, memes and
                other good stuff.<br><br>

                You know what else I love? Puns! I have been writing down all the puns I made and there is a
                section on this site dedicated to them! If you also happen to love puns, I strongly advise you
                to check them out! Please note that you read them at your own risk, as many of them are really bad jokes!<br><br>

                Please do note that this site is currently under development, hence a lot of the content will be incomplete as I am working;
                but I am currently updating my site regularly with new information and content.
