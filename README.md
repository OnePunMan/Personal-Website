Welcome to the repository of my personal website! In this file you will find some useful information on my repo in case you want to fork it and play around with it.

This repo depends on 4 frameworks:
1. Bootstrap
2. JQuery
3. Font Awesome
4. Google Fonts

All these dependencies can be imported through CDN's or through locally installed packages. The `package.json` file contains all the information and you can simply install the dependencies using the `npm install` command.

As of right now, the local server I use to test the website is the text editor Atom's built in live-server package, however, I do have intentions of writing my own simple Node server some time in the future.

The live server of the webpage will be at http://onepunman.me.
